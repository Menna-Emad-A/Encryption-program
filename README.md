# Encryption/Decryption Tool

## Overview
This tool provides a graphical user interface for encrypting and decrypting text using various cryptographic algorithms. It supports classical ciphers like Caesar, Affine, and Playfair, as well as modern encryption with AES. Users can easily switch between encryption and decryption modes, select different algorithms, and manage their plaintext and ciphertext.

## Features
- **Multiple Encryption Algorithms**: Support for Caesar Cipher, ROT13, ROT1, Affine Cipher, Hill Cipher, Playfair Cipher, and AES.
- **Graphical User Interface**: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.
- **Encrypt and Decrypt Modes**: Easy toggling between encrypting and decrypting text.
- **File Operations**: Save encrypted or decrypted text to a file.
- **Key Management**: Securely input keys needed for various algorithms.

## Prerequisites
To run this application, you need:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy library
- pycryptodome library
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python)
